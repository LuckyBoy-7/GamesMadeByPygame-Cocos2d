They called him  DeathsingerDeathsinger  ArdoniaOur world Ardonia is a vast land  home to many diverse people  strange creatures  and dangerous monsters  Hidden among the shadows of dense forests  beneath the sands of treacherous deserts  and froen within the ancient mountains of the north  are secrets and mysteries  which have eluded our comprehension throughout the ages  Few of these mysteries however  have attracted such fascination as the Ardoni species  for which the land shares its name  The Ardoni possess the unique ability  to wield great powers  Songs known as Songs  The strongest of these powers were referred to as  Prime SongsPrime Songs  and were deemed too powerful for the Ardoni to wield freely  Thus  they were given to the masters of the four Ardoni clans  as a sign of peace and unity  Because of this  the clans were blinded to a great danger  From within the fires of the Nether realm  an army set out to conquer the Overworld  They vanquished the kingdoms and people of Ardonia  as they spread across the land  But they were not to remain unchallenged  EnderknightThe Enderknights returned during these dark times  long having been guardians of the Overworld  The two opposing realms clashed with a fury of inconceivable power  Yet the Nether had prepared well for this invasion  and even the legendary Enderknights could not stop them  With no hope of victory  the kingdoms called upon the Ardoni to wield  the Prime Songs  Reluctantly the clans agreed and held a tournament  to determine which Ardoni would become their champion  and wield all four Prime Songs  One rose above the rest  persistent  cunning  and powerful  The champion had been found  When presented with the Prime Songs however  he revealed himself as  IngressusIngressus  Voltarisleader of the longforgotten and dreaded Voltaris clan  Outraged  the masters refused to give Ingressus the Prime Songs  for it was due to their misuse of such power  that they had been banished long ago  That night  while the clans debated their next course of action  Ingressus set out alone  to reclaim the Prime Songs  KaltarisOne by one he slayed the masters of the Kaltaris  SendarisSendaris  Mendorisand Mendoris clan  Through these dark deeds  he became known  as the Deathsinger  The fourth and final master  Aegus Nestoris survived the massacre  thus protecting the last and most powerful Prime Song  The Ardoni  mourned the tragedy  They vowed to hunt down the Deathsinger  and to prevent him from obtaining the final Prime Song  It was at this time that the Voltaris clan returned from exile  However  even with their support  he knew that he was outmatched  With all of Ardonia now his enemy  there was only one place to turn  ChronosThe Deathsinger met with King Chronos of the Nether  and formed the most powerful alliance ever known  And thus  Great Warbegan the Great War  RendorThe Enderknights rallied under King Rendor  and fought the Nether head on  The humans reassembled their armies  The Ardoni clans wielded their Songs of old  Magnorites The Magnorites came from the south  Felina the Felinas from the west  Some even say  He was there  But despite everything  the Deathsinger  and the Nether armies  could not be stopped  The tides of this conflict turned  after a young Ardoni joined the fight  Skilled with the Songs  Achillean Nestoris was able to unite  and lead the armies to victory  which earned him the name  TidesingerTidesinger  With his leadership and the Enderknight forces  the nether army was forced to retreat back into the Nether  With no allies  Mount Velgrinthe remaining Voltaris fell back to Mount Velgrin  Here the Tidesinger fought the Deathsinger alone  and both were defeated  The Prime Songs were recovered  and distributed amongst the clans once more  signaling an end  to the Great War   Cxp  KD  Peace was restored to Ardonia  and a time for rebuilding and healing began  The wounds caused by the Deathsinger however  will be felt forever  Wall of TimeThe Great War th Wall of Time  HawkenHmm well Hawken I fail to see  Hawken?!    Uuh ah yyes exactly!  ThalleousSo you see what this means Thalleous?  Hawken  were you sleeping through  Look here!  Where do the Walls of Time say the final duel took place?  Mount Velgrin  Indubitably!  Most legends including these bungled Walls of Time fail to state  that the final duel took place on the mountains peak  Alright so  what does this mean?  Ive heard rumors of a presence on the peak of Mount Velgrin  Being the naturally curious scholar that I am  I sent a few scouts to transform those rumors into facts  That was two weeks ago  And  what was their report?  There was no report!  None ever returned!  Why do you think that is?  Im not Im not entirely sure  The Voltaris Thalleous the Voltaris!  You think the Voltaris are at Mount Velgrin?  Indubitably!  Im aware youve been hunting Voltaris ever since the Great War ended  so I brought you here to inform you of this lead  It has been years since I lost the trail of the Voltaris  I should ride to Mount Velgrin  and see for myself  AaaaAaaa  Hold up there Thalleous  Although Im no Chronicler  I feel it my duty to accompany you  and record what information we find  I would  also like to discover the fate of those I sent to investigate  Theres a chance well encounter the Voltaris  and who knows what other perils  Fear not Thalleous  for I am prepared to fight!  Wait  wwait  somewhere around here I have a weapon  unless I lost it  Ah! Here it is!  Very well  Come on then  Most likely this was all just a misunderstanding  This is where I sent the scouts  right here Thalleous  Someone was here  recently  I found their supplies  How peculiar  Why would they leave their belongings where others might find them?  Because they are still here  You must be Thalleous Sendaris  Ive heard many things about you  And I have heard nothing about you  Oh I know Ive made quite sure of that  So allow me to introduce myself  My name  Tygren Voltarisis Tygren Voltaris  As for you Thalleous Sendaris I know who you are  Champion  and I know what youve done to my clan  Your sword has slain many of my brothers  and once I kill you  I will take it and slay twice as many of yours!  So many years have we prepared for this  and you  are not about to interfere    Whatever the Voltaris are planning  I will stop it  We will send word to the other clans  and gather all Ardoni warriors who are willing to fight  When we find this Necrolord  Ill kill him myself and the rest will falter  You will watch helplessly as everything you fought for is destroyed and burned  Run Senn now!
